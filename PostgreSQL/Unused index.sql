This query retrieves information about user indexes in a PostgreSQL database and their associated tables. 
Here is a breakdown of the query:

Columns Selected:
table_name: The name of the table associated with the index.
index_name: The name of the index.
times_used: The number of times the index has been scanned.
table_size: The size of the table in a human-readable format.
index_size: The size of the index in a human-readable format.
num_writes: The total number of writes (updates, inserts, and deletes) on the table.
definition: The definition of the index.

Tables Used:
pg_stat_user_indexes: Provides statistics about user indexes.
pg_indexes: Contains information about indexes in the database.
pg_stat_user_tables: Provides statistics about user tables.

Conditions in the WHERE Clause:
idstat.idx_scan < 200: Filters out indexes that have been scanned fewer than 200 times.
indexdef !~* 'unique': Excludes indexes with a definition that includes the word 'unique'.
Ordering:

The result is ordered by idstat.relname (table name) and indexrelname (index name).
This query can be useful for analyzing the usage and size of indexes on user tables, identifying indexes that may need attention or optimization. The conditions in the WHERE clause can be adjusted based on specific criteria for your analysis.
